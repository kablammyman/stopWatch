# stopWatch
A small stop watch app made using the AllegroTimerLib 

I workout in the mornings at home, so between sets I have to rest certain amounts of time. I use this to set that time...or 
sometimes I need to time how long I can do a certain exercise or how fast I can run a certain distance. 
Why is it a normal app and not on my cell phone or something? Well, I have a pc hooked up to my TV and stero, so adding a timer
was only natural.

Its easy to use...just adjust the minutes, seconds, and miliseconds. 

Once count down time is set, pressing the DOWN arrow key will (re)start the count down. Once time runs out, a buzzer sounds.
Pressing the UP arrow key will (re)start the elapsed timer...it will run for ever!
SpaceBar or the on-screen start\pause button  pasues the time. Sometimes this button gets out of sync if you mix keyboard and on screen button usage.

It also has the actual time...even tho this app runs in a window and you can easily see your system clock, lol
